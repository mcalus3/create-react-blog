Learning is very important in a programmer's life. Despite this, a lot of people entering this field don't know how to go about it. I think that it's a tough question for everyone â€“ How much time you should be spending on learning? What topics you should cover? What sources you should learn from ðŸ¤”?

In the past, when I was looking at the job offers, on each of them there was these two pointless requirements:

- Fast learner
- Problem solver

I was like - come on, how could you **not** expect it from a programmer? How could someone even become one without being a fast learner?

Well, it could have sense if they would benchmark my fast learning skills on the interview - "Here is the book, you have 15 minutes to summarize it", but guess what - they didn't ðŸ˜€.

As time went by, I realized that absorbing big amounts of information squeezes the juice out of your brain and it's reasonable that some people tend to avoid it. Everyone has his own level of natural curiosity about the world (and that vary even among the topics).

I thought that I'm exceptionally curious person, but it's nothing compared to my son. He is 2 years old and instead of chasing other children on the playground he takes me to the parking and points at the letters on the license plates, asking me to read them aloud. Every car at the parking, everyday. He have such a strong need to discover all of these letters ðŸ˜®.

Being naturally curious can have its drawbacks. I remember that I was very often finding myself in a situation when I'm trying to explain something that is (for me) very interesting and important, but the person I talk to is nervously nodding his head in hope that I'll finish as fast as possible. For example RSA algorithm â€“ It's so simple and brilliant that I thought that everyone will be delighted to hear about it. Turns out that they are not ðŸ˜ª.

If you are such an exceptionally curious person, you have to be careful to not bore people to death. And as a teacher, it makes it harder to choose the right information for your learners â€“ not too obvious and not too specific, and your gut feeling won't help you with this.

But the biggest threat for the curious people is something different... [the dark playground](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html). I will be describing procrastination and surfing the web in more detail some other time because it deserves it's own post, but be informed. Sometimes I come to my senses with multiple wikipedia pages about the causes of the fall of the western roman empire opened and I wish I was a less curious person ðŸ˜….

Now the upsides - natural curiosity is the only protection from the software development specific "mental fatigue" I know. To start doing anything new in software development you have to deal with such a vast amount of unanswered questions, new terms to learn, small decisions and unknown problems, that without any internal drive to learn it all it's hard to keep going. If you don't already feel what I'm talking about, read [this story](https://swizec.com/blog/learning-a-new-field-is-super-hard-i-get-it-now-%f0%9f%98%85/swizec/8974) for example.

I can't imagine a way to improve oneself as a software developer without learning new things. And the less interested you are, the harder it is to learn. I think that you can recall your first encounters with coding. Wasn't there too much things at once that you didn't understand? Werent you afraid that for some reason suddenly your program will stop executing and you will never understand why? The machine is _always_ against us, and to get somewhere you have to understand how things work. Step by step.

On the other hand, I don't know how it's after, let's say, 10+ years of experience. Are people giving up, because they are tired of all this years of not-understanding? Or maybe they don't have to learn as much, because we are reinventing the wheel every Xâˆˆ<2,10> years?

So now something actually useful. What do I learn from?

- In my first three years as a coder I have read nearly 25 books, thanks to the fact that i was commuting to work by the train and had almost 1,5h everyday without nothing else to do. That was super effective on my early career.

- I follow people on the internetthat are role models for me. I read their blogs, their twitter threads. It keeps me motivated and helps with staying up to date with the newest tech.

- There are couple of podcasts, but I don't listen to them, so I don't know which to recommend,

- If you want to learn something super-specific, or gain practical skills, you will have to get your hands dirty some way. Either you follow some of the courses (platforms that I'm aware of and are nice are egghead.io and frontendmasters.com), or try to [Clone open source apps](https://www.swyx.io/writing/clone-open-source-apps/). And remember - the more interested you are in the application you are coding, the more motivation you will have. Take advantage of it.

If you are new to programming and want to learn, I highly recommend you all of the [Shawn Wang's Essays](https://www.swyx.io/writing)

When I was starting, i would to have some sort of guidance on what and how to learn, so I'll post here lists of all of the books i've read and people I follow for everyone to start learning from.

This is the list of books that I've read (ones I recommend to everyone are in bold):

    Ritchie, Kernighan - C Programming

    Mark Pilgrim - Dive into Pyton

    Doni Tamblyn - Laugh and learn

    Tom DeMarco - Peopleware

    **MichaÅ‚ Bartyzel - Getting things programmed (Polish only)**

    **"Uncle" Bob Martin - Clean Code**

3 Eric Dietrich https://daedtech.com/

4 Dan Abramov https://overreacted.io/

5 Kent C. Dodds https://kentcdodds.com/blog

7 James K. Nelson https://frontarm.com/articles

6 Shawn Wang https://www.swyx.io/writing

People I don't follow, but their blogs are real treasure troves:

7 Joel Spolsky https://www.joelonsoftware.com/

8 Bob Martin https://blog.cleancoder.com/

9 Patric McKenzie https://www.kalzumeus.com/

10 Eric Elliott https://medium.com/@_ericelliott

There is one more source that you definitely should look at if you are eager for learning - there are more lists like mine, for example the [Post graduatiom mind map](https://www.swyx.io/writing/post-graduation/), [developer roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap), [react-learning](https://github.com/ericdouglas/react-learning), [awesome-react](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react), or any other "awesome-X" github repo about the technology you would like to learn.

There is a lot of other wise things on the internet, i suspect that my list is not complete, but it's hard to remember everything ðŸ˜‰.

I recommend you to make your own to-do list of things that you plan to learn (you can start with the general concepts and break down them into proper subparts during the learning).

Sincerely yours,<br />
