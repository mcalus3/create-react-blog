Learning is very important in a programmer's life. Despite this, a lot of people entering this field don't know tow to go about it. I think that it's a tough question for everyone â€“ How much time you should be spending on learning? What topics you should cover? What sources you should learn from?

In the past, when I was looking at the job offers, on each of them there was these two pointless requirements:

- Fast learner
- Problem solver

I was like - come on, how could you **not** expect them from a programmer? How could someone even become one without being a fast learner?
Well, it could have sense if they would benchmark my fast learning skills on the interview - "Here is the book, you have 15 minutes to summarize it to us", but guess what - they didn't ðŸ˜€.

But as time went by I realized â€“ absorbing big amounts of information squeezes the juice out of your brain. Avoiding this is reasonable behavior.

Some people are naturally more curious and some of them less.

I thought that I'm exceptionally curious, but it's nothing in comparison to my son. He is 2 years old and instead of chasing other children on the playground he takes me to the parking and points at the letters on the license plates, asking me to read them loud. Every car at the parking, everyday. He have such a strong need to discover all of these letters.

Being naturally curious can have its drawbacks. It can be hard for teachers â€“ I remember that I was very often finding myself in a situation when I'm trying to explain something that is (for me) very interesting and important, but the person I talk to is only nodding his head in hope that I'll finish as fast as possible. For example RSA algorithm â€“ It's so simple and brilliant that I thought that everyone will be delighted to hear about it. Turns out that they are not ;(

If you are an exceptionally curious person, you have to be particularly careful to not bore people to death. And as a teacher, it makes it harder to choose the right information for your learners â€“ not too obvious and not too specific.

But the biggest threat for the curious people is something different... the [dark playground](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html). I will be describing procrastination and information addiction in more detail some other time, because it deserves it's own post, but be informed. Sometimes I come to my senses with multiple wikipedia pages opened about the causes of the fall of the western roman empire and I wish i was less curious person.

Ok, now the upsides...

And what I learn from? There are plenty of things on the internet. (blog posts, twitter, books, courses, podcasts, doing own side project)
