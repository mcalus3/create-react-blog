This is an announcement post of my blog, I'll explain _why_ I've decided to start blogging and _what_ would you find here in the future.

## Why I've decided to start blogging?

In the past, I thought that because I don't have much of my own experience, it's pointless to write a blog because all I can give to the readers is just things reposted from other sites. I feared that not being able to confront this with my own knowledge would make me just thoughtlessly passing hype posts from medium üòì

Yet I deeply wanted to stop being that stalker, which only observes people on the internet. I wanted to somehow jump into the community. The thing that finally convinced me was an experiment - I started writing down every problem that I saw in my workplace (mostly with the codebase and team cooperation) instead of just complaining in the kitchen. It quickly turned out that switching your brain to the state of noticing and writing down all the things, even the smallest ones, results in 15 different things **a day** that I consider enough valuable to write something about them. And writing makes me reflect on them even more.

I came to the conclusion that **my inexperienced and "junior" point of view is also valuable and that there is always someone who is a couple of steps behind me on this road.** And even if I'm not experienced enough to dispute on the content of other blogs, I can frame it in a different context, translate it or write my own code examples to it.

So I hope blogging would help me lead a more conscious and perceptive life. I hope it would help me reflect daily on what I've learned, what from it could be useful to others, and would help me connect with other people who are like me ü§ù

## So what do I want to write about (and when)?

I will be writing for the programmers. Sometimes it will be about the coding, sometimes about working in the organization and the career progression. Sometimes it would be just about computers, internet, learning, and stuff. I am aware that although it's hard to maintain inspiration in a long term, it's very important for readers to have something new at least once a week. I'll try to stick to that rule. For now, I have to finish writing my master thesis, but I think that in April I'll start writing regularly.

I hope you will want to read some of it üòÖ

Sincerely yours,<br />
~Marek
